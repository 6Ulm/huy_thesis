abstract = {Existing knowledge of how cortical responses link to conscious content in humans is either inferred from animal models or from human studies limited by lower spatial resolution. While previous studies could relate distinct categorical percepts (faces vs. places) to signal differences across brain areas, measuring responses at submillimeter resolution allowed us to link subcategory conscious percepts (vertical vs. horizontal motion) to amplitude changes of separate populations within the same brain area. Furthermore, preferences for horizontal and vertical motion were organized into columnar clusters. We pave the way for future studies investigating if columnar clusters represent subcategorical distinctions in conscious content different from motion or in high-level perceptual and cognitive phenomena. The specific contents of human consciousness rely on the activity of specialized neurons in cerebral cortex. We hypothesized that the conscious experience of a specific visual motion axis is reflected in response amplitudes of direction-selective clusters in the human motion complex. Using submillimeter fMRI at ultrahigh field (7 T) we identified fine-grained clusters that were tuned to either horizontal or vertical motion presented in an unambiguous motion display. We then recorded their responses while human observers reported the perceived axis of motion for an ambiguous apparent motion display. Although retinal stimulation remained constant, subjects reported recurring changes between horizontal and vertical motion percepts every 7 to 13 s. We found that these perceptual states were dissociatively reflected in the response amplitudes of the identified horizontal and vertical clusters. We also found that responses to unambiguous motion were organized in a columnar fashion such that motion preferences were stable in the direction of cortical depth and changed when moving along the cortical surface. We suggest that activity in these specialized clusters is involved in tracking the distinct conscious experience of a particular motion axis.}

We compared how {vlFC} areas interacted with other brain areas in 25 humans and 25 macaques using the same methods. We identified a core set of 11 {vlFC} components that interacted in similar ways with similar distributed circuits in both species and, in addition, one distinctively human component in ventrolateral frontal pole. Fundamental differences in interactions with posterior auditory association areas in the two species were also present-these were ubiquitous throughout posterior human {vlFC} but channeled to different frontal regions in monkeys. Finally, there were some differences in interregional interactions within {vlFC} in the two species.},

Here we propose a general framework for understanding similarities and differences between the brains of primates. The approach uses white matter blueprints of the whole cortex based on a set of white matter tracts that can be anatomically matched across species. The blueprints provide a common reference space that allows us to navigate between brains of different species, identify homologous cortical areas, or to transform whole cortical maps from one species to the other. Specializations are cast within this framework as deviations between the species’ blueprints. We illustrate how this approach can be used to compare human and macaque brains.},

The complex mosaic of changes in brain morphology and functional organization that have shaped the mammalian cortex during evolution, complicates attempts to chart cortical differences across species. It limits our ability to fully appreciate how evolution has shaped our brain, especially in systems associated with unique human cognitive capabilities that lack anatomical homologues in other species. Here, we develop a function-based method for cross-species alignment that enables the quantification of homologous regions between humans and rhesus macaques, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, we find cross-species similarity in functional organization reflects a gradient of evolutionary change that decreases from unimodal systems and culminates with the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default mode network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default mode network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, has changed in a complex manner during human evolution – even within subnetworks.},

Cortical adaptations, however, can affect different aspects of brain architecture, including local expansion of the cortical sheet or changes in connectivity between cortical areas. We distinguish different types of changes in brain architecture using a computational neuroanatomy approach. We investigate the extent to which between-species alignment, based on cortical myelin, can predict changes in connectivity patterns across macaque, chimpanzee, and human. We show that expansion and relocation of brain areas can predict terminations of several white matter tracts in temporo-parietal cortex, including the middle and superior longitudinal fasciculus, but not the arcuate fasciculus. This demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus underwent additional evolutionary modifications affecting the temporal lobe connectivity pattern. This approach can flexibly be extended to include other features of cortical organization and other species, allowing direct tests of comparative hypotheses of brain organization.},

This has led to the proposal of new registration methods using features derived from functional and diffusion imaging. However, as yet there is no consensus over the best set of features for optimal alignment of brain function. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of a new Multimodal Surface Matching ({MSM}) algorithm capable of driving alignment using a wide variety of descriptors of brain architecture, function and connectivity. The versatility of the framework originates from adapting the discrete Markov Random Field ({MRF}) registration method to surface alignment. This has the benefit of being very flexible in the choice of a similarity measure and relatively insensitive to local minima. The method offers significant flexibility in the choice of feature set, and we demonstrate the advantages of this by performing registrations using univariate descriptors of surface curvature and myelination, multivariate feature sets derived from resting {fMRI}, and multimodal descriptors of surface curvature and myelination. We compare the results with two state of the art surface registration methods that use geometric features: {FreeSurfer} and Spherical Demons. In the future, the {MSM} technique will allow explorations into the best combinations of features and alignment strategies for inter-subject alignment of cortical functional areas for a wide range of neuroimaging data sets.},

Hyperalignment parameters based on responses during one experiment--movie viewing--identified 35 common response-tuning functions that captured fine-grained distinctions among a wide range of stimuli in the movie and in two category perception experiments. Between-subject classification ({BSC}, multivariate pattern classification based on other subjects' data) of response-pattern vectors in common model space greatly exceeded {BSC} of anatomically aligned responses and matched within-subject classification.

	abstract = {Inter-individual variability in the functional organization of the brain presents a major obstacle to identifying generalizable neural coding principles. Functional alignment—a class of methods that matches subjects’ neural signals based on their functional similarity—is a promising strategy for addressing this variability. To date, however, a range of functional alignment methods have been proposed and their relative performance is still unclear. In this work, we benchmark five functional alignment methods for inter-subject decoding on four publicly available datasets. Specifically, we consider three existing methods: piecewise Procrustes, searchlight Procrustes, and piecewise Optimal Transport. We also introduce and benchmark two new extensions of functional alignment methods: piecewise Shared Response Modelling ({SRM}), and intra-subject alignment. We find that functional alignment generally improves inter-subject decoding accuracy though the best performing method depends on the research context. Specifically, {SRM} and Optimal Transport perform well at both the region-of-interest level of analysis as well as at the whole-brain scale when aggregated through a piecewise scheme. We also benchmark the computational efficiency of each of the surveyed methods, providing insight into their usability and scalability. Taking inter-subject decoding accuracy as a quantification of inter-subject similarity, our results support the use of functional alignment to improve inter-subject comparisons in the face of variable structure-function organization. We provide open implementations of all methods used.},

	abstract = {An important goal of cognitive brain imaging studies is to model the functional organization of the brain; yet there exists currently no functional brain atlas built from existing data. One of the main roadblocks to the creation of such an atlas is the functional variability that is observed in subjects performing the same task; this variability goes far beyond anatomical variability in brain shape and size. Function-based alignment procedures have recently been proposed in order to improve the correspondence of activation patterns across individuals. However, the corresponding computational solutions are costly and not well-principled. Here, we propose a new framework based on optimal transport theory to create such a template. We leverage entropic smoothing as an efficient means to create brain templates without losing fine-grain structural information; it is implemented in a computationally efficient way. We evaluate our approach on rich multi-subject, multi-contrasts datasets. These experiments demonstrate that the template-based inference procedure improves the transfer of information across individuals with respect to state of the art methods.},

  abstract = {The squared Wasserstein distance is a natural quantity to compare probability distributions in a non-parametric setting. This quantity is usually estimated with the plug-in estimator, defined via a discrete optimal transport problem which can be solved to ε-accuracy by adding an entropic regularization of order ε and using for instance Sinkhorn's algorithm. In this work, we propose instead to estimate it with the Sinkhorn divergence, which is also built on entropic regularization but includes debiasing terms. We show that, for smooth densities, this estimator has a comparable sample complexity but allows higher regularization levels, of order ε1/2, which leads to improved computational complexity bounds and a strong speedup in practice. Our theoretical analysis covers the case of both randomly sampled densities and deterministic discretizations on uniform grids. We also propose and analyze an estimator based on Richardson extrapolation of the Sinkhorn divergence which enjoys improved statistical and computational efficiency guarantees, under a condition on the regularity of the approximation error, which is in particular satisfied for Gaussian densities. We finally demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed estimators with numerical experiments.},
