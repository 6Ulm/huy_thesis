% This chapter presents three contributions to the unbalanced OT-based divergences,
% namely the unbalanced OT, unbalanced Co-Optimal Transport and unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein.

% The first contribution is an ongoing work on an alternative solver for the entropic UOT problem
% \ref{eq:discrete_ent_uot}, which has not yet been studied in the literature,
% to the best of our knowledge.
% We called this approach \textit{INexact Proximal Unbalanced optimal Transport} (INPUT),
% since it is a straightforward application of the inexact Bregman Proximal Point (BPP) algorithm
% to the UOT problem. We present the derivation of INPUT, then illustrate how
% it can overcome the limitations of the MM and Sinkhorn-based methods,
% while being orders of magnitude faster in our toy experiments. Despite the simplicity,
% its convergence analysis remains a challenging open problem and is under our active research.

This chapter summarizes the results from the paper \citep{Tran23} and addresses
the unbalanced extension of Co-Optimal transport.
Optimal transport (OT) compares probability distributions by computing a meaningful alignment
between their samples. Co-optimal transport (COOT) takes this comparison further
by inferring an alignment between features as well. While this approach leads to
better alignments and generalizes both OT and Gromov-Wasserstein distances,
we provide a theoretical result showing that it is sensitive to outliers
that are omnipresent in real-world data. This prompts us to propose unbalanced COOT
for which we provably show its robustness to noise in the compared datasets.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for OT methods in incomparable spaces.
With this result in hand, we provide empirical evidence of this robustness
for the challenging tasks of heterogeneous domain adaptation with and without
varying proportions of classes and simultaneous alignment of samples and features across
single-cell measurements.

% The last section presents the results from \citep{Thual22} and addresses the applications of
% unbalanced extension of fused Gromov-Wasserstein in human brains alignments.
% Individual brains vary in both anatomy and functional organization, even within a given species.
% Inter-individual variability is a major impediment when trying to draw generalizable conclusions
% from neuroimaging data collected on groups of subjects.
% Current co-registration procedures rely on limited data, and thus lead to very coarse
% inter-subject alignments.
% In this work, we present a novel method for inter-subject alignment based on Optimal Transport,
% denoted as Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW).
% The method aligns cortical surfaces based on the similarity of their functional signatures in
% response to a variety of stimulation settings, while penalizing large deformations of
% individual topographic organization.
% We demonstrate that FUGW is well-suited for whole-brain landmark-free alignment.
% The unbalanced feature allows to deal with the fact that functional areas
% vary in size across subjects. Our results show that FUGW alignment significantly
% increases between-subject correlation of activity for independent functional data,
% and leads to more precise mapping at the group level.
