    \textbf{Measure theory} & \\
    $\cP(\cX)$ & Space of probability measures on a space $X$ \\

    $\cM^+(X)$ & Space of finite nonnegative Borel measures on a space $X$ \\

    $U(\mu, \nu)$ & Set of admissible couplings, whose marginals are $\mu$ and $\nu$ \\

    $\cX$ & \makecell[l]{All weighted objects, including weighted space, metric-measure space, \\
    measure network, weighted matrix, measure hypernetwork, \\
    sample-feature space, are written in italic} \\

    $\#$ & Push-forward operator \\

    $\pi_{\# 1}, \pi_{\# 2}$
    & \makecell[l]{First and second marginal distributions of measures $\pi$, respectively \\
    \ie, if $\pi \in \cM^+(X \times Y)$, then $\pi_{\# 1}(x) = \int_Y d\pi(x,y)$ and
    $\pi_{\# 2}(y) = \int_X d\pi(x,y)$} \\

    $\mu \otimes \nu$ & Product measure between two measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ \\

    $\rightharpoonup$ & Weak convergence \\

    $m(\mu)$ & Mass of measure $\mu$ \\

    $\Delta_n$ & Set of histograms of $n$ bins, \ie,
    $\Delta_n := \{ p \in \bbR^n_{> 0}: \sum_i p_i = 1 \}$ \\

    & \\

    \textbf{Linear algebra} & \\
    $X$ & Matrix in discrete setting, or space in continuous setting \\
    $\otimes$ & \makecell[l]{Tensor-matrix multiplication. Given a $4$D-tensor $L$ and a matrix $P$, \\
    the matrix $L \otimes P$ is defined by $(L \otimes P)_{ij} = \sum_{k,l} L_{ijkl} P_{kl}$} \\
    $\oplus$ & sum defined by $(f \oplus g)(x, y) = f(x) + g(y)$ \\
    $\odot$ & Element-wise multiplication \\
    $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ & Scalar product \\
